{{< expand "Are my ratings anonymous? Or will my vote be named?" "..." >}}
We want everyone to feel comfortable participating in DeCartography. Therefore, all crowd workers who participate in DeCartography will be given a new, automatically generated identifier. This identifier will not be publicly visible with your wallet address, so everyone can rate you privately.

{{< expand "What are the tasks that will be evaluated in DeCartography?" "..." >}}
Currently in Beta, DeCartography covers a portion of the task of generating a social graph from Gitcoin's GR data.
In the future, we intend to increase the number of tasks and types of tasks by allowing users to specify the set of addresses they wish to analyze, similar to the crypto version of Mturk.

{{< expand "Can non-Gitcoin researchers and others download and analyze the data?" "..." >}}
No, they will not. No. Currently, we are working on this as a PoC with Gitcoin, so it is closed to the public.
Please contact @DeCartography if you are interested in the demonstration.
